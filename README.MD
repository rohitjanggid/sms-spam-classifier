# 📱 SMS Spam Detection (NLP + Machine Learning)

This project is a **Machine Learning based SMS Spam Classifier** that can detect whether a given message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.  
It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques with **TF-IDF vectorization** and ML models to classify text messages.  
A **Streamlit Web App** is also included for real-time predictions.
